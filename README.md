# XGBoost Model Implementation  

This project demonstrates the implementation of **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for predictive modeling. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.  

## Features  
✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance  
✅ Model evaluation using accuracy metrics  
✅ Visualization of feature importance  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- XGBoost  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn  

Install dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install xgboost pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage  
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
